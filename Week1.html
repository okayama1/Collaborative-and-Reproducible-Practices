# Lectures and tutorials  

* The .bold[lectures] will be a combination of presentations with interactive exercises.

   - Each lecture will commence with an  .bold[.green["open frame"]] (5-10min) where students can talk about their learning,
   share comments, issues and resources with the rest of the class. That time can also be used for questions (questions will be welcomed at anytime during the lectures too).

* The .bold[tutorials] will be entirely based on computer practicals and you will be working individually as well as in groups.

# What is replicable research?

"Research results are
generally considered .green[replicable] if there is sufficient information available for
independent researchers to make the same findings using the same procedures with existing and or new data"



---
class:  left, top

# Replication and literate programming
Lykken [1968] calls “operational replication”:

* .bold[Operational replication] “requires the complete
and open exchange of data, procedures, and materials”. 

* .bold[Literate programming]: Donald Knuth coined the term literate programming in the 1970s to refer to a source file
that could be both run by a computer and “woven” with a formatted presentation document
[Knuth, 1992].

# Literate programming

.content-box-duke-green[
Literate programming is an approach to writing reports using software that weaves together the source code and text at the time of creation.

# Reproducible research and replicability

**Definitions by the USA National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine**:

- .green[Reproducibility] ("computational reproducibility") means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. 

- .green[Replicability] means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data


  
[Refere: Report on reproducibility and replicability](https://www.nap.edu/read/25303/chapter/1#xix)

# Reproducible research

* Working to make your research reproducible does require extra upfront effort.

* Making a project reproducible from the start encourages you to use better
work habits.

* It should push you to bring your data and source code up to a higher
level of quality than you might if you “thought ‘no one was looking’ ” [Donoho,
2010, 386]. 

* Reproducible research needs to be stored so that other researchers can actually access the data and source code. 

* Changes are easier to implement `\(\rightarrow\)` specially when using dynamic reproducible documents.

* Reproducible research has higher impact.

## Tools for reproducible research

* .content-box-soft[ R programing language
]
   - R enables researchers to read data, create data visualizations and run statistical analyses.
   - R has thousands of libraries
   - R has a very active development community that is constantly expanding.
  
  

* .content-box-soft[R libraries/packages --&gt; facilitate reproducibility:
]
     * Knitr and Rmarkdown:
       - Allow us to connect R-based analyses to
presentation, papers and reports documents created with markup languages such as LaTeX and
Markdown


---
class:  left, top
# Rstudio 

* .content-box-soft[ Is an integrated developer environment (IDE): 
]
  - R by itself has the capabilities necessary to gather and analyze data,
and with a little help from knitr/Rmarkdown and markup languages, present
results in a way that is highly reproducible. 


* .content-box-soft[ RStudio allows you to do all of
these things more easily. 
]

  - It also is a happy medium between R’s text-based interface
and a pure GUI. 
  - It is not the only IDE! Examples `\(\Rightarrow\)` Emacs
  - It is closely integrated with the version control programs Git and SVN.
  

*   .content-box-soft[It has a cloud counterpart called .bold[Rstudio Cloud]
]

# Rstudio Cloud

Rstudio version in the Cloud

&lt;img src="figs/Rstudiocloud.png" width="90%" /&gt;

Why??


---
# Rstudio Cloud

- Allows the users to run reproducible reports without the need of installing any additional software or configurations in their own computer. It basically looks exactly like Rstudio but it runs in the cloud and can be loaded using any browser.  

- Rstudio Cloud allows us to work in the same environment
regardless the computer operating system that each of you have in your computers.

- Rstudio will provide the means for us to first focus on learning R and Rstudio without having to worry about installing them locally in each computer (we'll do that later once you are more familiar with the language and the Rstudio environment).

# Version control

.bold[.green[Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time
so that you can recall specific versions later.]]


---
class:  left, top

# Git

"Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source 
code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among 
programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its 
goals include speed, data integrity,  and support for distributed, non-linear workflows"
