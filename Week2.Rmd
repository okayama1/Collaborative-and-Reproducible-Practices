# Reproducibility and Replicability

Definitions by the USA National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine:

- .green[Reproducibility] ("computational reproducibility") means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. 

- .green[Replicability] means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data

# Elements of a reproducible project
 
 - .green[We need to have a plan to organize, store and make the project files available].

 - All the elements of the project should be  files.

- All files should be stored within the project location (typically a folder).

# What is Markdown? 

.green[Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use
to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.] It was 
created by John Gruber in 2004. [Read more here](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

* Markdown is a "text" formatting syntax
* Can be easily render to more complex formats such as:
pdf, html, pdf, doc ...

## Good news!

- We can use markdown inside a type of R documents called R markdown files (Rmd) $\rightarrow$ text can be included and combined with R code.

Today, we'll learn how to do it.

# R markdown documents 

- R Markdown document is a file format for making dynamic documents with R.
- R markdown documents have extension Rmd

---
class: left, middle
# Dynamic documents 

Rmarkdown + Knitr --> dynamic document

- Rmarkdown allow us to not only use Markdown to write the 
.green[text] in the report, it also allow us to include .green[R code].

- .green[Knitr] with the help of .green[Pandoc] allow us to render documents that contain
a mixed of the components above (text + code)

- .green[Pandoc]  is a universal document converter

- .green[Pandoc] is a  used by the Rmarkdown package to .bold[.green[render]] an 
Rmd file into a new format. For example, an Rmd file can be .bold[.green[render]] into HTML, PDF,
or Microsoft Word file...

# R code chunks

You can quickly insert R chunks linto your file with

- the keyboard shortcut .green[Ctrl + Alt + I (OS X: Cmd + Option + I)]
- the .green[Add Chunk]  command in the editor toolbar
- or by typing the chunk delimiters 

### Chunk options
Chunk output can be customized with [knitr options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) 
arguments, set inside the R chunk header .green[{r, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}]:

- .green[include = FALSE] prevents code and results from appearing in the finished file. R Markdown still runs the code in the chunk, and the results can be used by other chunks.
- .green[echo = FALSE] prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. This is a useful way to embed figures.

---
# More R code chunks

- .green[eval = FALSE] does not evaluate (or run) this code chunk when knitting the Rmd document.
- .green[message = FALSE] prevents messages that are generated by code from appearing in the finished file.
- .green[warning = FALSE] prevents warnings that are generated by code from appearing in the finished.
- .green[fig.cap = "Text"] adds a caption to graphical results.
- .green[fig.align = "center"] set the position of where a figure generated in an R code chunk will appear in the report
_ Plus many more!

<br>
See the [R Markdown Reference Guide (here)](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) 
and [knitr options (here)](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) 
for a complete list of knitr chunk options.


---
# Global options 

To set **global options** that apply to every chunk in your file, call **`knitr::opts_chunk$set()`** in a code chunk. Knitr will treat each option that you pass to `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` .green[.bold[as a global default that can be overwritten in individual chunk headers]].

For example:

**`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`**

[More info here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) and [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)

# Caching
- If document rendering becomes time consuming due to long computations, you can use knitr caching to improve performance. 

- [Read more on R code Chunks options (here)](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/) describes how caching works

- The [cache examples (here)](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/cache/) provide additional details.

.green[cache = TRUE] is an option within the R code chunks.

# Computer Paths

* A _path_ is the complete location or name of where a computer 
file, directory, device, or web page is located.

## Examples

  - .bolder[Windows] $\rightarrow$ .purple[C:\documents\ETC5513]
  - .bolder[Mac/linux] $\rightarrow$ .purple[/Users/documents/ETC5513]
  - .bolder[Internet path] $\rightarrow$ .purple[http://www.google.com]

# Absolute and Relative Paths

* .bold[Absolute or full path]
An absolute or full path begins with a drive letter followed by a colon, such as D: or /users.
  - Windows: C:\documents\charlie
  - Mac/linux: /Users/documents/courses/ETC5513

* .bold[Relative path]
A relative path refers to a location that is .green[relative to a current directory] (or folder):
  - ETC5513/exercise.Rmd
(no matter where the folder sits things can actually run)
.content-box-soft[

When a new project is created RStudio:
.content-box-soft[ 
* Creates a project file (with an .bold[.Rproj] extension) within the project directory.

* This file can also be used as a shortcut for 
  opening the project directly from the filesystem.

* Creates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary
files (e.g. auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. 

* Loads the project into RStudio and display its name in the Projects toolbar
